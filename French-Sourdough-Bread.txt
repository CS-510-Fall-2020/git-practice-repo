Sourdough French Bread (originally Taste of Home + Paul Hollywood)

Ingredients
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
1-3/4 cups cool water + more
1/2 cup Sourdough Starter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons salt
3 cups bread flour (or 3 cups of all purpose + 2 tablespoons of gluten)

Directions
1 – In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the Sourdough Starter, oil, sugar, salt and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough additional flour to form a soft ball.

2 – Turn onto a floured surface; gently knead 20-30 times (dough will be slightly sticky). Place in a greased bow, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

3 – Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each into a 12x8-in. rectangle. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch ends to seal. Place, seam side down, on two greased baking sheets; tuck ends under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.

4 – With a sharp knife, make four shallow diagonal slashes across top of each loaves.

5 – Bake at 400° for 15 minutes. Brush loaves with the remaining cornstarch wash. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
