Tuscan Kale Salad

Ingredients: 

1 bunch Dinosaur kale
1/2 tsp salt
1 garlic clove
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup of olive oil
1/4 tsp ground pepper
1/4-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1/3 cup of finely grated romano cheese
croutons

Directions: 

1. Wash the kale and break it into bite-sized pieces, removing the center stem of each leaf. Dry in a salad spinner and set aside. 

2. Use a mortor and pestel to grind the salt into a powder. Add a roughly chopped garlic clove and grind the salt and garlic into a paste. Add some lemon juice to the mortor to rinse and remove the garlic/salt paste into the rest of the juice. 

3. Add the pepper and red pepper flakes to the lemon/garlic/salt mixture. Add the olive oil to the mixture. Add the grated romano cheese to the dressing and whisk thoroughly to combine. 

4. Pour the dressing over the kale and mix thoroughly, so that each piece is covered with dressing. Let sit for 5-7 minutes, during this time the lemon juice will wilt the kale slightly. Add croutons and toss salad before serving.
